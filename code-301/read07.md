[How I explained REST to my brother](https://gist.github.com/brookr/5977550)

## What makes the web work?
- http is the first part that tells the browser what protocol to use. 
  - This was one of the most important breakthroughs in computing history --- this is because it is able to tell us and retrieve something from anywhere in the world. 

## REST
- Provides a defiinition of a "resource" which is what the http is pointing to (a webpage). 


APIS - use the same protocols from above to retrieve information



Fieldng and company built the web to talk to any machine anywhere in the world. the machines that we use had to be upgraded to be able to do that. 
- "redirect" is when a machine needs something that it does not have, so it asks another machine for it. The URL is how this is done.
  - URLs can be thought of as nouns they are the objects that we want.
  - adversely, a CS theory called "polymorphism" which acts as a verb. *different nouns can havve the same verb applied to them*. 
    - You can GET nouns also, ( GET, PUT, and DELETE )
