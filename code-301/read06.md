- Node is event-based, non-blocking, and asynchronous I/O
  - it is run to execute HS on our computers. "JavaScript runtime."
  - only targets one runtime... It is supported in different browsers...Compatibility is pretty good!



-manipulates, uses template literals, which is why we learned all about objects.



- npm lets us download the necessary files to use node


### Node and what it is used for. 
- it automates the process of developing a modern JS app
- Lets us run JS on the server... This is cool

### execution model
1. pass async tasks to the event loop along with a call back 
2. the event loop efficientlymanages a thread pool and executes the taskes efficiently
3. executes each callback as tasks complete
