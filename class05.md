### How to add images to pages
Storing images on your site
- You will want to save the image file to a folder in your assets called images. Then you will call in your code using an img tag with the source, alternative text, and a title. ex) pp. 99
```
<img src="images/quokka.jpg" alt="A family of quokka" title="The quokka is an Australian marsupial that is similar in size to the domestic cat." />
```

### Choosing the right format
You want images to emphasize the content on the page. 
**JPEGs** are the best format to save images as. 

### Optimizing images for the web
You do not want images that are bigger or higher resolution than the average computer. That just slows down load times.
- Save inmages at the size that you plan to use that on the web page. Also save them in the appropriate format.
