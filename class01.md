### Summary/Things to look out for while reading 

***************
* HTML pages are text documents.
* HTML uses tage (characters that sit inside angled brackets)to give the info they surround special meaning 
    - Tags are oftenn referred tp as e;e,emts 
    -  Usually come in pairs < >
    - Opening tags carry attributes, which tell us more about the content of that element
    - Attributes require a name and a value
    - Learn where tags can go and what they are used for. 
**************
This is what an HTML structure looks like. 
``` 
<html>
    <body>
        <h1> Heading </h1>
        <p> Paragraph  </p>
        <h2> Subheading </h2>
        <p> Supporting paragraph </p>
        <h2> Another subhead </h2>
        <p> Paragraph <p>
    </body>
</html>

```
Make sure to use both opening and closing tags.
 - Tags act as container that tell you about the content.

### Attributes
```
<html lang="en-US">
```
- Attr tells us information about the content that is inside of the tags. The above snippet denotes that the html content is in english.
