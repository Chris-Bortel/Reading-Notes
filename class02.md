## Chapter 2: “Text” (pp.40-61) 
- Headings and paragraphs
  - h1-h6; h1 is the biggest/boldest
  - [p] Denotes paragraph
  - [b] makes words appear bold

## Chapter 2: “Basic JavaScript Instructions” (pp.53-84)
Intructions are given through script
- Statement - the individual intructions or step that the computer is given
- Comments can help people reading the code understand what the instructions are doing

### Variables: How to declare them
- First you need say that you want to use a variable
  - you do this by giving the variable a name and a value
Variables store lots of things
- Numbers
- Strings
- Booleans

### Arrays
Special type of variable that stores a list of variables
-Indexes start at i[0] colors = ['white', 'black', 'blue']
  - i[0] = white

### Expressions
Evaluates into a single value
### Operators
Expressions rely on operators to create a single value from multiple values (ex. 3*2 returns a value of 6)
### Arithmetic operators
Mathmatical operators that are used with numbers
### String operator
- + is the only one, it is used to join strings together


## Chapter 4: “Decisions and Loops” only up to the section on switch statements (pp.145-162)
Loops - perform the same set of steps repeatedly

### Evaluating conditions and conditional statements
Decisions are made up of two parts
1. An expression is evaluated, this returns a value
  - Code checks the status of the scrips by comparing two values using a comparison operator 
  - [==] is equal to 'hello' is equal to 'hello'
  - [!=] is not equal to  'hello' is not equal to 'goodbye'
  - [===] strict equal to --- Has to be exactly the same of it will return false
  - [!==] strict not equal to Has to be different of it will return false
  - Also > , < , >= , <=
2. A conditional statement says what to do in a given situation

### Logical operators

- && - Logical and
  -The logical AND is used to see if a value is greater than or equal to the pass value
- || - Logical or
- ! - Logical Not
