[GitHub Repo](https://github.com/Chris-Bortel/Reading-Notes)
# Domain Modeling
This is object-oriented programming

1. The new keyword instantiates (i.e. creates) an object.
2. The constructor function initializes properties inside that object using the this variable.
3. The object is stored in a variable for later use.

- function prototype - methods can be added to a constructor function's prototype. ... HOW DOES THAT WORK? Stunt double?


#### locating a method on the prototype object, it is best practice in js

### Summary from the Article
!!!check out the summary to the article and sum it up!!!
# Chapter 6: “Tables” (pp.126-145) (Html)
Tables are a grid made up of rows and columns
## I am going to learn 
- Use the four key elements for creating tables 

1. table:
2. tr: table row
- tables are drawn out row by row using the `<tr>` element
3. td: table data
- The cells in each row are represented in with the `<td>`
4. th: table headings
- The cells could also be represented by the `<th>` element if it is in the header.
**Span**
- cells of a table can span more than one row or column by using the rowspan and colspand attributes
- **Long Tables** can be split into a `<thead>` `<tbody>` and `<tfoot>`

- Represent complex data using tables
- add captions to tables




# Chapter 3: “Functions, Methods, and Objects” (pp.106-144) (JS)
**Functions** lets us put a set of related statement tocether that are use in and for a single task
- The can take paramenters, which is the info that is needed for the functions to work. These functions are built to return a value
An **Object** is a series of variables and func that model something that is tangeable in the world. 
  - variables are known as properties and functions are methods. !!!
The web browser implements the objects. The objects represent bot the browser withdow and the html doc that is loaded into the browser
## Built in Objects!
These help with writing sccripts
- String
- Number
- Math
- Data

## Arrays and objects can both contain the other!
