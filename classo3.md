## Chapter 3: “Lists” (pp.62-73)

There are Three types of lists in HTML:
- Ordered lists - each item in the list is numbered 'ol'
- Unordered lists - these begin with bullet points 'ul'
- definition lists - a set of terms along with the def for the terms 'dl'
  - 'dt' contains the term being defined
  - 'dd' used to contain the definition

  Nested Lists
  - mulitiple lists can be put in to a list

## Chapter 13: “Boxes” (pp.300-329)

X Controlling size of boxes
X Box model for borders, margin and padding 
X Displaying and hiding boxes

**Important** Css treats HTML elements as if they are in their own box
- There are bunches of different properties to change the appearance of these boxes
- Boxes have three available properties that can be manipulated:
  1. Border
    - Border width
    - border style
    - border color

    'The border property allows you to specify the width, style and color of a border in one property (and the values should be coded in that specific order).' (pg. 312)

  2. Margin
    - Controls the gap between boxes
    - Margins may overlap 
  3. Padding
    - Padding dictates how much space is between the content and the box border

Centering Content
- need to set a width for the box or it will take over the entire width
- set the margins to auto

Text-align property aligns the text inside of the box

Display:
- this property lets you change inline elements into block-level elements or vice versa. It can also hide elements. Use 'none' to do that.

You can do so much with css to boxes
- You can hide boxes
- You can give border images
- Make box-shadows
- Give rounded corners
- Make elliptical shapes

**Important** : You can make content more readable by controlling the width of the box that contains it.
