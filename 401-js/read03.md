[Wikipedia Article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_model)
  - Data modeling allows the developer to sus out what the application is going to do, look like, and feel like. 
 - Allow developers to explore the flow of data and how each component relates to one another. 
  - Allows them to figure out what problems they are goiing to run into and figure out how to overcome them prior to starting a code base. 
  - This is also a way to have a discussion with the client in order to verify what they want and get an agreement that this is what the application will do.

- What purpose do CRUD operations serve?

- What kind of database is Postgres? What kind of database is MongoDB?

- What is Mongoose and why do we need it?

- Define three related pieces of data in a possible application. An example for a store application might be Product, Category and Department. Describe the constraints and rules on each piece of data and how you would relate these pieces to each other. For example, each Product has a Category and belongs in a Department.
