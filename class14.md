## google and the path to create the perfect team

Project Aristotle — to study hundreds of Google’s teams and figure out why some stumbled while others soared. 

The researchers eventually concluded that what distinguished the ‘‘good’’ teams from the dysfunctional groups was how teammates treated one another.  
- The right norms, in other words, could raise a group’s collective intelligence, whereas the wrong norms could hobble a team, even if, individually, all the members were exceptionally bright.

### two behaviors that all the good teams generally shared
1. members spoke in roughly the same proportion, a phenomenon the researchers referred to as ‘‘equality in distribution of conversational turn-taking.’’
  - If by the end of the day, everyone had spoken roughly the same amount. ‘‘As long as everyone got a chance to talk, the team did well,’’ Woolley said. ‘‘But if only one person or a small group spoke all the time, the collective intelligence declined.’’

2. they were skilled at intuiting how others felt based on their tone of voice, their expressions and other nonverbal cues.
- sensitivity and understanding others emotions are key. 
- a free-flowing team would be better for me.


### take away
- groupd norms that discoursage equal speak are all business and no social interaction, does not allow for understanding peoples feelings. They stay as individuals and do not make for a collectively intelligent team

## A good team
"people may speak over one another, go on tangents and socialize instead of remaining focused on the agenda. The team may seem inefficient to a casual observer. But all the team members speak as much as they need to. They are sensitive to one another’s moods and share personal stories and emotions. While Team B might not contain as many individual stars, the sum will be greater than its parts."

# psychological saftey
Edmondson defines as a ‘‘shared belief held by members of a team that the team is safe for interpersonal risk-taking.’’ Psychological safety is ‘‘a sense of confidence that the team will not embarrass, reject or punish someone for speaking up,’’ Edmondson wrote in a study published in 1999. ‘‘It describes a team climate characterized by interpersonal trust and mutual respect in which people are comfortable being themselves.’’
  - Rozovsky’s study group at Yale was draining because the norms — the fights over leadership, the tendency to critique — put her on guard. Whereas the norms of her case-competition team — enthusiasm for one another’s ideas, joking around and having fun — allowed everyone to feel relaxed and energized.

-other important behaviors
  - having clear goals
  - crating a culture of dependability.

-Sharing personal sometimes hard to talk about things can make working together easier, because accepting those things helps establish psychological saftey
#### Important
"The behaviors that create psychological safety — conversational turn-taking and empathy — are part of the same unwritten rules we often turn to, as individuals, when we need to establish a bond. And those human bonds matter as much at work as anywhere else. In fact, they sometimes matter more."

- "to be fully present at work, to feel ‘‘psychologically safe,’’ we must know that we can be free enough, sometimes, to share the things that scare us without fear of recriminations. "

## My takeaway
 is that teams need to be able to be themselves at work and be accepted as individuals and team members.
