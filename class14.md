## google and the path to create the perfect team


The company’s top executives long believed that building the best teams meant combining the best people. They embraced other bits of conventional wisdom as well, like ‘‘It’s better to put introverts together,’’ said Abeer Dubey, a manager in Google’s People Analytics division, or ‘‘Teams are more effective when everyone is friends away from work.’’ But, Dubey went on, ‘‘it turned out no one had really studied which of those were true.’’

Project Aristotle — to study hundreds of Google’s teams and figure out why some stumbled while others soared. 

The researchers eventually concluded that what distinguished the ‘‘good’’ teams from the dysfunctional groups was how teammates treated one another.  
- The right norms, in other words, could raise a group’s collective intelligence, whereas the wrong norms could hobble a team, even if, individually, all the members were exceptionally bright.

### two behaviors that all the good teams generally shared
1. members spoke in roughly the same proportion, a phenomenon the researchers referred to as ‘‘equality in distribution of conversational turn-taking.’’
  - If by the end of the day, everyone had spoken roughly the same amount. ‘‘As long as everyone got a chance to talk, the team did well,’’ Woolley said. ‘‘But if only one person or a small group spoke all the time, the collective intelligence declined.’’

2. they were skilled at intuiting how others felt based on their tone of voice, their expressions and other nonverbal cues.
- sensitivity and understanding others emotions are key. 
- a free-flowing team would be better for me.


### take away
- groupd norms that discoursage equal speak are all business and no social interaction, does not allow for understanding peoples feelings. They stay as individuals and do not make for a collectively intelligent team

## A good team
"people may speak over one another, go on tangents and socialize instead of remaining focused on the agenda. The team may seem inefficient to a casual observer. But all the team members speak as much as they need to. They are sensitive to one another’s moods and share personal stories and emotions. While Team B might not contain as many individual stars, the sum will be greater than its parts."
