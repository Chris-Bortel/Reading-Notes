## [How to Solve Programming Problems](https://simpleprogrammer.com/solving-problems-breaking-it-down/)

### When solving programming problems follow these guidelines
- "Measure twice, cut once", in other words, take time to understand the problem domain and layout the ground work prior to even thinking about coding the problem out. 
- Follow the KISS principle

#### Simple set of steps
- Read the problem completely twice.
- Solve the problem manually with 3 sets of sample data.
- Optimize the manual steps.
- Write the manual steps as comments or pseudo-code.
- Replace the comments or pseudo-code with real code.
- Optimize the real code.

### READ THE PROBLEM AS MANY TIMES AS YOU REQUIRE
- I need to understand what they want before I can give it to them
- solve it manually before you start throwing code around
- solve the problem with at least three different inputs.

## Big step to understand
- think about what your brain is actually doing in order to solve the problem. 
- write down everything in your head that goes on while solving the problem (English first)



Example:
<br>

```
If I give you a string “Zebra”, and ask you to reverse it, most people will do the following manual steps.

Write “Zebra” down.
- Start a new word, and put “a” as the first letter.  (Why –> because it is the last letter, we want to start here)
- Put “r” down as the 2nd letter.  (Why –> because it is the next letter backwards from the last letter we copied)
- Put “b” down as the 3rd letter.  (Why –> same as above)
- Etc
```

- write down each little step and why I wrote it down

## write pseudo cod or comments
Pseudo Code is super important and will help me get better at these problems.
- focus on taking the steps that I created up above, and them put them in an editor as comments or write them as psuedo(fake) code. After that, writing the actual code will be easier.

### Things to touch up on
- Create a list --- just make an array haha
- Sort a list or array --- could use sort, but how do I do this without that method?
- Create a map or dictionary
- Loop through a list or dctionary 
- Parse strings
- convert from string to int, int to string, etc.

# Important to note
- when you find a problem that involves multiple large steps or is very complicated, you wan to tray and find a wau to cut the pronblem directly in hald and then follow the problem solving process that I just learned
